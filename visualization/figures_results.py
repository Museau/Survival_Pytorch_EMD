# Figure. Here we study how the composition of censored and
# uncensored patients during training impacts the C-index mean Â±
# standard error over the 5 fold in the SUPPORT2 dataset. The
# validation and test sets are fixed and the training set has censored
# patients introduced by marking patients as censored at random.
# The plot starts at 30% because the dataset has that many censored
# patients by default. We find that the WM classification loss is
# robust to the introduction of censored data.
